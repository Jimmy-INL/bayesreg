Tutorial slides on bayesian regression models

This repo contains the code for the tutorial presented in the **Bayes Days** event at the *University of Liverpool*. 
I also contains additional sampling codes, and an animation like the one presented in *Hennig's technical report*. 

To be able to run the deck in a local machine, type on terminal 

```bash
nbconvert tutorial-p1.ipynb --to slides --template slides_reveal.tpl --post serve
```

This will open up the deck in your default browser. Some useful keyboard shortcuts for the slides are:

```
<arrows> : to move around
<f> : to enter fullscreen mode
<b> : to enter a blank screen
<o> : for an overview - doesn't show properly with the concave template
```
